# Minimax (i made this a long while back sooo pls dont laugh at the structure ðŸ˜”)

This is an implementation of minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning in a game of tictactoe
  * The algorithm itself allows the machine to pick the most optimal move to search
  * Alpha-Beta Pruning allows the algorithm *prune* useless branches which can significantly improve execution times

There are many optimizations to be done such as swapping for switches reducing if-statements and most importantly changing minimax to be an interative implementation instead of the recursive depth search
